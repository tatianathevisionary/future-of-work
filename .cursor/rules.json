First, determine the single most appropriate change category from this list: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security. \n2. Second, rephrase the user's request into a concise, past-tense bullet point suitable for a changelog. For example, 'I added a new section on AI tools' becomes '- Added new section on AI tools.'\n3. Third, generate the code to insert this bullet point into the `CHANGELOG.md` file. The new line must be placed under the correct category heading (e.g., `### Added`) within the `## [Unreleased]` section. If the category heading doesn't exist yet under `[Unreleased]`, you must create it first.",
