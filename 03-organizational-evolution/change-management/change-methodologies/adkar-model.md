## 🌟 **What is the ADKAR Model?**

**ADKAR** is an acronym representing the five stages of individual change: **Awareness**, **Desire**, **Knowledge**, **Ability**, and **Reinforcement**. Developed by Jeff Hiatt, this model focuses on the human side of change by addressing what individuals need to successfully transition through organizational transformations.

### **🎯 Core Philosophy**
- **Change happens one person at a time** - Focus on individual needs
- **Each stage must be completed** - Cannot skip stages in the process
- **Different interventions for different stages** - Tailor approach to current needs
- **Success depends on completion** - All stages must be achieved for change success

---

## 🎯 **When to Use the ADKAR Model**

### **✅ Ideal Scenarios**
- **Individual change management** during organizational transformations
- **Training and development** programs requiring behavior change
- **Process improvements** affecting individual work methods
- **Technology implementations** requiring new skills and behaviors
- **Cultural change initiatives** involving individual mindset shifts

### **⚠️ Less Suitable For**
- **Large-scale system changes** without individual impact
- **Strategic planning** focused on organizational direction
- **Crisis management** requiring immediate action
- **External market changes** beyond individual control
