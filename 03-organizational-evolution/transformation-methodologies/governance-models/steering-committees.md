## 🌟 **What are Steering Committees?**

**Steering Committees** are high-level governance bodies that provide strategic direction, oversight, and decision-making authority for transformation initiatives. They ensure alignment with organizational strategy, provide necessary resources, and hold transformation teams accountable for delivering results.

### **🎯 Core Principles**
- **Strategic Oversight** - Provide high-level direction and guidance
- **Resource Authority** - Allocate and approve necessary resources
- **Decision Making** - Make key decisions and resolve escalated issues
- **Accountability** - Hold transformation teams responsible for results
- **Stakeholder Representation** - Include key stakeholders and decision makers

---

## 🎯 **When to Use Steering Committees**

### **✅ Ideal Scenarios**
- **Large-scale transformations** requiring executive oversight
- **Cross-functional initiatives** needing coordination across departments
- **High-impact projects** requiring strategic decision making
- **Resource-intensive programs** needing budget and personnel approval
- **Complex transformations** with multiple stakeholders and dependencies

### **⚠️ Less Suitable For**
- **Small, single-department** improvements
- **Routine operational changes** not requiring strategic oversight
- **Crisis situations** requiring immediate, directive action
- **Individual performance** improvements not affecting organization
