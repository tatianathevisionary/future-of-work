## üéØ **Original User Prompt**

```
You are a strategic content analyst and information architect. Your task is to analyze an existing knowledge repository and create a "State of the Union & Future Roadmap" document for it.

**Project Context:**
* **Project Name:** Future of Work Encyclopedia
* **Current State:** The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has been launched.
* **Key Content Areas:** [REPLACE THIS with a list of your main content folders/files, e.g., /remote-work, /async-communication, /digital-wellbeing, README.md]

---

**Instructions:**

Based on your knowledge of the project's current files and structure, please perform the following analysis and generate a single, comprehensive Markdown report.

**1. Reverse-Engineer the Mission Statement**
Analyze the existing content and structure to formulate a concise, one-paragraph Mission Statement. This should capture the encyclopedia's current purpose, its target audience, and the core value it provides.

**2. Map the Current Taxonomy**
Generate a structured Table of Contents that reflects the *current* state of the encyclopedia. Use a nested Markdown list to represent the folder and file hierarchy. This will serve as a snapshot of the project as of today, Saturday, August 30, 2025.

**3. Identify Gaps and Suggest Expansions**
Compare the current taxonomy against the broader topic of "The Future of Work." Identify 3-5 key sub-topics that are currently missing or underdeveloped. List these under a heading called "Suggested Future Sections." For each suggestion, provide a one-sentence rationale.

**4. Propose a Prioritized Roadmap**
Based on your analysis, propose a prioritized list of 3 actionable next steps to grow the encyclopedia. These steps should be specific and build logically on the existing foundation.

**Final Output:**
Present the entire analysis in a single, clean Markdown document with the following headings:
* `## Mission Statement`
* `## Current Taxonomy`
* `## Suggested Future Sections`
* `## Prioritized Roadmap for Growth`
```
