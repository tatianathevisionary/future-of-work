## üéØ **Original User Prompt**

```
You are a master storyteller. Your task is to write a compelling "founding story" for a new project based on the creator's journey. The tone should be personal, authentic, and inspiring.

**Project Name:** [Name of the Project]

**Creator's Journey (Key Narrative Points):**
* **The Initial Spark:** What was the very first idea or problem you were trying to solve? (e.g., "I wanted to build a master curriculum for Data Science.")
* **The First Pivot/Evolution:** How did that initial idea change? What did you realize? (e.g., "I realized I should build a foundational encyclopedia first.")
* **The Detour or Side-Quest:** Did you take a break or get interested in another topic? What was it? (e.g., "I got fascinated by organizational operations and started a separate research project.")
* **The Synthesis Moment (The "Aha!"):** How did these different paths or ideas unexpectedly connect? (e.g., "The structure I built for my operations research was the perfect format for a new, better encyclopedia.")
* **The True North:** What is the final, true mission of the project that emerged from this journey? (e.g., "I realized the real topic that connected all my interests was 'The Future of Work'.")

**Instructions:**
Weave these points into a flowing narrative. Structure it with a clear beginning (the initial idea), a middle (the journey of discovery and change), and an end (the project's final mission). Use headings to break up the story into logical chapters.

**Final Output:**
Present the entire analysis in a single, clean Markdown document with the following headings:
* `## Mission Statement`
* `## Current Taxonomy`
* `## Suggested Future Sections`
* `## Prioritized Roadmap for Growth`
```
