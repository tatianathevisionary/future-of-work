# Help Docs Setup Prompt

You are an information architect. Your task is to generate the foundational documents for a project's help and contribution section.

**Task:**
Generate the initial content for an `FAQ.md` file and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

**Project Context:**
The project is the "Future of Work Encyclopedia," a knowledge repository.

**Details:**
1. **FAQ Document (`FAQ.md`):**
   * Create a list of 5-7 relevant questions a new user or contributor might have.
   * Examples: "What is the goal of this encyclopedia?", "Who is the target audience?", "How can I suggest a new topic?".
   * Provide a brief, helpful answer for each question.

2. **Contribution Guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):**
   * Create a guide for potential contributors.
   * Include sections for "How to Contribute," "Style Guide" (e.g., writing tone, Markdown formatting), and "Pull Request Process." Keep the instructions clear and encouraging.

**Output:**
Provide the complete content for both files, clearly separated by their filenames.

**Additional Context:**
This encyclopedia aims to document emerging trends, technologies, and methodologies that are shaping the future of work, including remote work, AI integration, new management practices, and evolving workplace dynamics.
