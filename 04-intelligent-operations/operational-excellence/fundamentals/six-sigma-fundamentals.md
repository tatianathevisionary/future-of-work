## 🌟 **What is Six Sigma?**

**Six Sigma** is a data-driven methodology and set of tools for process improvement that aims to eliminate defects and reduce variation in any process. Developed by Motorola in the 1980s and popularized by General Electric, Six Sigma uses statistical methods to identify and eliminate causes of defects and minimize variability in manufacturing and business processes.

### **🎯 Core Philosophy**
> *"In God we trust, all others must bring data"* - W. Edwards Deming

Six Sigma is built on the principle that all work is a process, and all processes have variability. By measuring, analyzing, and controlling this variability, organizations can achieve near-perfect quality levels of 3.4 defects per million opportunities.

### **📊 Six Sigma Quality Levels**

| **Sigma Level** | **Defects per Million** | **Yield %** | **Cost of Quality** |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1σ | 691,462 | 30.9% | Not competitive |
| 2σ | 308,538 | 69.1% | Not competitive |
| 3σ | 66,807 | 93.3% | 25-40% of sales |
| 4σ | 6,210 | 99.38% | 15-25% of sales |
| 5σ | 233 | 99.977% | 5-15% of sales |
| **6σ** | **3.4** | **99.99966%** | **<1% of sales** |
