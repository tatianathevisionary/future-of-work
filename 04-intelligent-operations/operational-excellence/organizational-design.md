## 🌟 **What is Organizational Design?**

**Organizational Design** is the process of creating and modifying organizational structures, systems, and processes to achieve strategic objectives. It involves designing how work is organized, how decisions are made, how information flows, and how people collaborate to deliver value.

### **🎯 Core Principles**
- **Strategic Alignment** - Design supports organizational strategy
- **Performance Focus** - Structure enables high performance
- **Flexibility** - Design adapts to changing needs
- **Collaboration** - Structure promotes effective teamwork
- **Efficiency** - Design minimizes waste and maximizes value

---

## 🎯 **When to Use Organizational Design**

### **✅ Ideal Scenarios**
- **Organizational restructuring** or reorganization
- **Growth and expansion** requiring new structures
- **Performance issues** related to organizational structure
- **Strategic changes** requiring structural adaptation
- **Merger and acquisition** integration

### **⚠️ Less Suitable For**
- **Crisis situations** requiring immediate action
- **Minor process improvements** not affecting structure
- **Individual performance** issues not related to structure
- **Temporary initiatives** with short-term focus
