## üåü **What are Internal Developer Platforms?**

**Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** are self-service layers that enable development teams to independently interact with their organization's delivery setup. IDPs provide developers with workflows, tools, and infrastructure components they need to build, test, deploy, and monitor applications without requiring deep infrastructure knowledge.

### **üéØ Core Philosophy**
> *"You build it, you run it" - but with the right tools and guardrails*

**Key Principles:**
1. **Self-Service** - Developers can provision resources independently
2. **Golden Paths** - Opinionated, well-supported ways of working
3. **Developer Experience** - Optimized for developer productivity and satisfaction
4. **Platform as a Product** - Treat the platform as an internal product with users
5. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - Abstract complexity while maintaining control
