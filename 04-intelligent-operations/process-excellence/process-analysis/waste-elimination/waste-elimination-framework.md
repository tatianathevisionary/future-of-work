# üóëÔ∏è Waste Elimination Framework
## **Systematic Approach to Identifying and Eliminating Process Waste**

---

## üéØ **Overview**

The Waste Elimination Framework provides a systematic methodology for identifying, analyzing, and eliminating non-value-added activities (waste) from organizational processes. This framework is based on Lean principles and focuses on maximizing customer value while minimizing resource consumption.

## üèóÔ∏è **Waste Elimination Framework**

### **1. Types of Waste (8 Wastes)**
- **Defects** - Products or services that don't meet quality standards
- **Overproduction** - Producing more than customer demand
- **Waiting** - Idle time due to poor process flow
- **Non-Utilized Talent** - Underutilization of employee skills
- **Transportation** - Unnecessary movement of materials or information
- **Inventory** - Excess materials, work-in-progress, or finished goods
- **Motion** - Unnecessary movement of people or equipment
- **Extra Processing** - Unnecessary process steps or complexity

### **2. Waste Categories**
- **Process Waste** - Inefficient process steps and procedures
- **Resource Waste** - Underutilized or misallocated resources
- **Time Waste** - Unnecessary delays and waiting time
- **Quality Waste** - Defects and rework activities
- **Information Waste** - Unnecessary data processing and storage

### **3. Waste Elimination Levels**
- **Strategic Level** - High-level waste identification and elimination
- **Operational Level** - Day-to-day waste reduction
- **Process Level** - Process-specific waste elimination
- **Individual Level** - Personal work waste reduction
- **System Level** - Systemic waste elimination
