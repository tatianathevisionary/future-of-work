## 🌟 **What is AI Governance?**

**AI Governance** is a comprehensive framework for managing the ethical, legal, and operational risks associated with artificial intelligence systems. It encompasses policies, processes, and controls to ensure AI systems are fair, transparent, accountable, and compliant with regulations.

### **🎯 Core Objectives**
- **Ensure AI ethics** and responsible development
- **Maintain regulatory compliance** across jurisdictions
- **Manage AI risks** and operational challenges
- **Build stakeholder trust** and confidence
- **Enable sustainable AI adoption** and scaling

---

## 🎯 **When to Use AI Governance**

### **✅ Ideal Scenarios**
- **Enterprise AI deployment** and scaling
- **Regulated industries** (finance, healthcare, government)
- **High-risk AI applications** with significant impact
- **Multi-stakeholder AI projects** with diverse requirements
- **International AI operations** across multiple jurisdictions

### **⚠️ Less Suitable For**
- **Research and experimentation** only
- **Low-risk AI applications** with minimal impact
- **Small-scale deployments** without compliance requirements
- **Organizations** without AI production experience
