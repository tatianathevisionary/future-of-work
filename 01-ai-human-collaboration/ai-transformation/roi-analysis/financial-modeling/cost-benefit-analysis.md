## üìä **ROI Calculation Methodologies**

### **1. Basic ROI Formula**
```
ROI = (Net Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs √ó 100%
```

### **2. Net Present Value (NPV)**
- **Time Value of Money** - Discount future cash flows
- **Risk Adjustment** - Incorporate risk factors
- **Long-term Perspective** - Multi-year benefit analysis
- **Sensitivity Analysis** - Scenario-based modeling

### **3. Payback Period**
- **Simple Payback** - Time to recover initial investment
- **Discounted Payback** - Time value-adjusted recovery
- **Risk-Adjusted Payback** - Risk-weighted recovery period
- **Break-even Analysis** - Point of cost-benefit equilibrium

### **4. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- **Investment Efficiency** - Rate of return on investment
- **Hurdle Rate Comparison** - Minimum acceptable return
- **Risk-Adjusted IRR** - Risk-weighted return calculation
- **Multiple IRR Handling** - Complex cash flow scenarios
