## 📋 **Versioning System**

### **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**

The Future of Work Encyclopedia follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

## 🔄 **Automated Release Workflows**

### **GitHub Actions (Future Enhancement)**

We plan to implement automated release workflows using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Automated Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
```

### **Benefits of Automation**
- **Consistent release process** across all releases
- **Reduced human error** in release creation
- **Faster release cycles** and deployment
- **Better tracking** of release artifacts

## 📊 **Release Tracking & Metrics**

### **Release Metrics to Track**

#### **📈 Quantitative Metrics**
- **Release frequency** (time between releases)

- **User adoption** (downloads/updates per release)

#### **📋 Qualitative Metrics**
- **User feedback** and satisfaction scores
- **Community engagement** with new features
- **Documentation quality** and completeness

## 🚨 **Emergency Releases**

### **When to Use Emergency Releases**

Emergency releases (hotfixes) should be used for:
- **Critical security vulnerabilities**
- **Severe bugs** affecting core functionality
- **Data integrity issues**
- **Legal compliance** requirements

### **Emergency Release Process**

1. **Create hotfix branch** from the last stable release
2. **Make minimal changes** to fix the critical issue
3. **Test thoroughly** to ensure no new issues are introduced
4. **Create patch release** (e.g., v1.2.1)
5. **Deploy immediately** to production
6. **Communicate clearly** about the emergency nature of the release
